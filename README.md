# Sign-Up-Page
A Sign Up page using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
I have created a Signup page for taking input from the user such as Username, Password, etc. and a Submit button. 
The webpage contain the following validations : 
  * If user did not fill any field or put wrong length of password and clicked on the submit button, appropriate message should be displayed.
